## üíª Project

The experience of playing online is immensely pleasurable when we can share this experience with friends, but even living in such a connected time, we still have people who don't meet to play together, and who can often end up giving up on the experience because they face it alone. may not be the most profitable, especially in online games.


At first our application will allow people to choose their favorite games, and to find other players with the same objective, to win!!
